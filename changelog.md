# Carnalitas v1.3

## Tweaks

### Slavery System

* Slave relations GUI now uses amazing scrollbar technology, allowing you to see 7 rivals AND 7 slaves.
* You can now see how much a slave will sell for in the Sell Slave tooltip.
* You can now sell slaves to people who can't afford a slave's full price. You will just get whatever they can pay. (The AI on the other hand won't be so generous and will always ask for the full price when selling you a slave.)
* Clarified the factors that affect a slave's price in the Slave Market encyclopedia entry/tooltip.
